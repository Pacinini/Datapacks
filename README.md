# Datapacks

Some minecraft datapacks I attempted to make.

Food is just a datapack to do /trigger food and get 16 carrots. Thought it would be simple to do so I tried making it.

no_sleep is a datapack that allows users on a server to request whether another player can sleep. This is to prevent servers with reduced sleeping percentage to have people accidently sleep when someone doesn't want it to become daytime.
